package CryptographyEncryptDecrypt;

//Cryptography converts data into a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. The converted data is however 
// unreadbale for unauthorized user.
// In cryptography, the fictional characters as Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, and Eve are used to make it easier for people to understand certain cryptography implementations
// ex: "Hello World"   (encryption)  ===> "#@w3twT" (encrypted text/ cipher text) :Encryption converts a readable message into a unreadable message.
//ex: "#@w3twT"  (decryption)  ===> "Hello World" (plain text)                     ::Decryption converts a unreadable message into a readable message.
//The character Eve is often used to represent an aevesdropper

// there are two basic key algorithm Symmetric and Asymmetric
// + Symmetric: A symmetric required the same key for both encrypt of a  plaintext and decrypt of a cipher text.
//   + This same key is also called a shared secret.
